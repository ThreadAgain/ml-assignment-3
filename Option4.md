## Time Series Forecasting using Recurrent Neural Networks
For this assignment, you are going to implement and compare various simple
recurrent neural networks for time series prediction. Do this in the following
steps:

• Find any ﬁve time series datasets. Describe these datasets. Make sure to
indicate if the datasets are stationary or non-stationary.

• For self-study, ﬁnd out how cross-validation should be applied to time series.
As a starting point, refer to

You have to make use of an appropriate cross-validation process in your analysis
of the performance of the simple recurrent neural networks. Describe the process
used in your report.

• Perform the necessary data pre-processing on the selected datasets. Describe
what you have done and provide justiﬁcations.

• You are going to use an Elman recurrent neural network, a Jordan recurrent
neural network, and a multi- recurrent neural network. Describe these neural
networks in your report. You may select any optimization algorithm and
appropriate loss function. Describe what you have used in your report.

• You have to make sure that the networks do not underﬁt or overﬁt. Describe the
process that you have implemented to prevent undertitting and overﬁtting.

• Carefully deﬁne the empirical process that you have followed, and describe
this process in your report. The process has to include settings for all
hyperparameters, neural network architecture, performance measures, and the
process followed to determine which simple recurrent neural network performed
best for each of the datasets.

• Present and discuss your results, and conclude on which simple recurrent
neural network performed best.
